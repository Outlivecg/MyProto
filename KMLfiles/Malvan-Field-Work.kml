			<name>Chromite Mine, Near Vagade Village</name>
			<description><![CDATA[<img style="max-width:500px;" src="file:///C:/Users/User/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot (45).png">
There were 2 different types of chromite deposits that took place when Dharwar Craton was formed, they are; Stratiform and Podiform Deposits.
The Stratiform deposits are formed during the crystallization of magma and are associtated with subduction zone and arc magmatism, whereas, the podiform deposits are already crystallised and later gets mingled with foreign magmas and finally gets deposit. Podiform Deposits are characteristic of sindhdurgh craton and proterozoic ophiolite sequences like Ladakh, Andaman and Nagaland.
These deposits in sindhudurg are one of the oldest Sargur sequence found here which is composed of metamorphosed schists containing Cr (chromium). Also igneous rocks like pryoxinite/peridotite and amphibolites are found. At the spot we find Serpentized Talc Schist. Ultramafic Coarse grained rocks have gone thorugh the process of serpentinization and it is metamorphosed to amphibolite to serpentine schist. Light green to green coloured patches of serpentine are found in the rocks. The Chromite in this mine has gone through leaching due to monsoonal activities where the water has reacted with the Iron in Ultramafic rocks and leached it out to form a red band going through out the samples of the mine. We also find Serpentinized Hornblende Schist with Asbestos and Hornblende Schist.
Deposits of this mine belongs to Dharwar origin (Archean –Proterozoic) more commonly of Archean period. The ophiolitic sequences are found which are the remmants of past oceaic crust, which has now been obducted and are the basement of oceanic crust.

Sand mining is a practice that is used to extract sand, mainly through an open pit. Chirag Sanditex Pvt Ltd is a mining company which is specialized in mining sand from sandstone and this sand is used for different purposes of construction. This mine has the largest exposed area of the Kaladgi Ferrogenous Sandstone. Iron rich sand is also extracted here as a source of iron. The Sand is of 30/40(Filter Size) Iron Rich Characteristic used in making iron or steel. Wet Sand from the mine is taken into large cylinders and heated using fuel. An artificially created rain water utilizing water pit located inside the mine is used for filteration of sand and purification. Ferrogenous Sandstone of Kaladgi is formed due to Erosion of Haematite Quartzite which is used as the sand.
•After confirmation that this mine can be used economically, following are the processes done for the mining.
•First the raw sand is extracted in the formed of sandstone then crushed to form sand.
•Then the sand is washed in the machines and pits are made in the ground for primary washing and water is stored in the pits.
•Then the wet sand is dried in a separate room.
•Then sand is filtered according to the particle size and its uses and weighed.
•Then it is exported or imported to various parts.
During rainy season the mine is kept closed and there are several places where landslides occur and it is important to identify the fault planes and joint to stop the collapse.
At its peak output, the mine employed almost 100 workers and generated profits revenues of ` 1-2 Lakh per day. Jhonsons tiles are generally manufactured from this sand. Fissile sandstone are generally used for making glass because in this sanstones the quartz grains break easily. 30/40 sand size or market size sand is the best size of sand and is exported to Cannada. Different industries use different grades of sand for their purposes.

At Station 1, we came across the basement rock i.e. Peninsular Gneiss. 
Stratigraphy: Peninsular Gneiss is the term used for gneissic and granitic rock that is exposed in the major part of Indian Craton. . The exposed outcrop was made of Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite Gneiss with intrusions of Tourmaline Bearing Quartz-Orthoclase Feldspars Pegmatite Veins having a graphic Texture. These gneisses consitute the basement for deposition of younger succession. There are migmatitic gneisses alternating with bands of amphibolites and tonalite, hence, they are also called as TTG complex. The Dharwar craton is Precambrian in age and is around 2600m.y.a in age which is known by U-Pb Method. It consists mainly of Ultra Mafics and Amphibolites. 
Petrology: The Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite Gneisses are formed by crustal anatexis where there is melting of previously formed crust and this is followed by uprising of magma due to its buoyancy. Such magmas have crustal contaminations. The sequence was formed due to a process called gravity settling. The TTG Gneisses show magmatic differentiation where heavier (mafic) minerals like Pyroxenes, Hornblendes, Biotites and others settle first and then the lighter (Felsic) minerals like quartz, feldspars, plagioclase settle down. Due to gravity settling three different phases are formed. Reddish mineral {Late}, Light mineral {Middle}, Dark mineral {Base}. The Granadiorite is formed by Sodic-Calc-Plagioclase, Tronjhemite Part is formed by Biotite and Na-Plagioclase and the Pyroxenes and Hornblendes form the Tonalitic Part. Low Density Hydrothermal Liquids form the Pegmatite Veins syn or post-magma crystallization. 
Composition of vein is Quartz+Feldspar(orthoclase dominant) where quartz is at boundaries and feldspars at core of veins. Some veins were even monomineralic in composition.
Structural: These gneisses also shows many sets of  joints joint,  in geology, a brittle-fracture surface in rocks along which little or no displacement has occurred. Present in nearly all surface rocks, joints extend in various directions, generally more toward the vertical than to the horizontal. Joints may have smooth, clean surfaces, or they may be scarred by slicken sides, or striations. Jointing does not extend to a very great depth in the Earth’s crust, because at about 12 kilometres (7.5 miles) even rigid rocks tend to flow plastically in response to stress... 2 main types of joints are found and they can be classified as;
Cooling joints- cooling joints are the joints which are formed genetically during the cooling of lava. The joint formation associated with cooling is typically polygonal because the cooling introduces stresses that are isotropic in the plane of the layer.
Tectonic joints- Tectonic joints are formed during deformation episodes whenever the differential stress is high enough to induce tensile failure of the rock, irrespective of the tectonic regime.
Two types of stresses are considered in the formation of joints.
• Normal stress
• Shearing stress.
Two main types of joints were observed in the section they can be classified as parallel joints known as sets of joints and also conjugate joints which are cross cutting joints.
  Foliation planes were observed in the granitic gneisses. Foliation are  planar arrangement of structural or textural features in any rock type, but particularly that resulting from the alignment of constituent mineral grains of a metamorphic rock of the regional variety along straight or wavy planes. Foliation often occurs parallel to original bedding.
There are 3 steps to finding out the foliation and the foliation planes.
• Look for the foliation planes.
• Hold the handle of the clinometers parallel to the foliation planes. 
• Measure the trend of the foliation planes with the help of the clinometers.

<img style="max-width:500px;" src="file:///C:/Users/User/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot (48).png">

Plunging Fold is seen in TTG Gneiss and the intruded veins have also been folded to form Ptygmatic Structure or Flanking Veins. This vein is in Syncform which is formed due to tectonic activity.

<img style="max-width:500px;" src="file:///C:/Users/User/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot (49).png">

The section showed the presence of a thick dolerite dyke which was intruding the peninsular gneiss with a trend of NW- SE and it showed a positive relief. This dyke was a feeder dyke and can be classified to be of the ambenalli type and a dyke feeds the flow of the molten hot magmatic melt. The dykes at the formation come in contact of substances which contanaminate it and which cause minor changes in the composition. The ambenalli dyke is the most primitive dyke of all and it is the least contaminated. 2 more dykes are present and named on the basis of the type area in which they are observed and named as bhushe and Podalpur.
       These dykes show a contamination in their compositions and the average contamination of the Podalpur dyke is 0.71% and the Bhushe shows an average contamination of 0.59%. theMahablashwar flow is very highly contaminated. The dykes that are present here are the cooling joints. There are 4 main types of dykes.
• Dykes trending E-W: these are the oldest dykes and are formed after the activation of the Son-Narmada lineament.
• Dykes trending N- S: These are the youngest and are related to the breaking up of India. 
• Dykes trending NW-SE OR NE-SW:  these are conjugate and were related to the collision of the Indian plate and the Eurasian plate. 
• Alkaline dykes: these dykes do not have a wide extent they are very short and range upto an average of 20mts.

Sindhdurg Conglomerate Base of Precambrian

Latitude - 16° 2'29.24"N
Longitude - 73°27'30.44"E
Altitude - 6.4m

Elongated meta-conglomerates clasts are found here. Conglomerates form the base which is Precambrian in age. Bandings are also seen as BMQ and BHQ. It shows alternate bands of silica and iron oxide. The sandstone has been metamorphosed into quartzite. It shows banding of light coloured fine grained quartz and dark coloured iron oxide which imparts red colour to the bands.

Cross sections of meta conglomerates which is an unconformity with composition and shapes are as follows:
•	Vein quartz.
•	Amphibolites
•	Quartz
•	Gneissic pebbles 
•	Jasper
•	Fuschite mica.

The Sindhudurg Fort is made up of the rock quartzite. At some places these quartzites show presence of some mica giving the rock a green colouration. This green mica is called as fuschite and hence the rock is called as fuschite quartzite. Imbricated Jasper is also observed within the fuschite quartzite.

This location was at some distance from kasal river near Rathivade village and there we encountered an outcrop of biotite garnet schist with very thin foliations and lineations. This Mica Garnet schist is the last remnant of Sargur Group.
Table 13 The Lineations and foliations present on the outcrop trend

Outcrop	200 ˚ - 20 ˚	35 ˚	110(W)

Some folds in which their plunges showed similar trend to that of the lineations were also present. A schistose outcrop was also found with minor faulting.
 
Station 2: Rathevadi
Latitude - 16°12'34.00"N
Longitude - 73°35'20.00"E
Altitude - 30.5m

Toward the west of Kasal River, the cobbly petromict orthoconglomerate is exposed. The clast of this conglomerate consists of quartz, vein quartz etc.
Table 14 Clast Measurements:
A	B	C
5	9	10.5
4.5	10	15
12	20	-

 As we move further towards west direction, the clast size of the conglomerate as well as the grain size of the rocks goes on decreasing. On westward migration we get boulder conglomerate followed by pebbly conglomerate, coarse to fine grained sandstone and ferruginous shale. This conglomerate forms basal conglomerate of kaladgi supergroup. This basal conglomerate represents the unconformity between sargur group and kaladgi supergroup. The sandstones and shales in this area part of Achara formation. This Achara formation is equivalent to Badami group of the Kaladgi supergroup.
The Achara sandstone and shale are subdivided into:
  
 
In the main Kaladgi basin, rocks are divided by lower Bagalkot group and upper Badami group. This division is based on structural characteristics i.e. rocks belonging to bagalkot group are slightly deformed, exhibits extensive folding and slightly faulting. The  rocks belonging to badami group are structurally undisturbed. The badami group rocks are gently dipping, at places they are horizontally settled.
Moving along kasalriver , after the conglomerate outcrop, we pass into Golvan sandstone followed by bagayat shale.
The Golvansandstones of this region exhibits well developed sedimentary structures such as tabular cross bedding, trough cross bedding, longitudinal bedding, lenticular bedding , ripple marks. It also consists of developed ichinofossils and mudcracks are present in upper section , hence Golvan sequence represents subtidal , intertidal and sandflat environment.
The Bagayat shale and fe shale exhibits structures such as horizontal parallel lamination, wave ripple lamination ,runzel marks and flaser bedding. This structures represents the higher mud flat environment.
Petrography: Mica Garnet Schist
Textures: The thin section consists of lepidoblastic texture. The quartz grains shows heterogranularmosic texture while some quartz grains show sieve texture. Few grains of biotiteshows relict texture.
Mineralogy: The rock is mainly composed of biotite, garnet and quartz. Some grains show biotite retrograding to chlorite. The thin section also consists of opaque minerals. The opaque minerals, biotite and quartz react to form garnet. There are two generations of quartz, one with mosaic texture and another are smaller in grain size.
Type of metamorphism: Regional metamorphism with retrogression.
Grade of metamorphism: medium grade metamorphism
Facies: Greenschist
 
Station 3: 
Latitude - 16°12'33.00"N
Longitude - 73°35'17.00"E
Altitude - 30.8m

The area consists of ferruginized  buff coloured sandstone with intercalations on thin shale laminatons. The sandstone exhibits bidirectional structure , showing decrease in grain size in downstream direction . The sandstone also consists of plumose structure, it is formed due to accumulation of breaking strain. 
The trend of sandstone bed is 1600N Dipping 230NW.
As we move along the outcrop, the sandstone exhibits layers of sedimentary structures. The lowest bed consists of round crest of ripple marks followed by trough cross bedding and top layer exhibits tabular cross laminations.
The dip of axis of trough is 270/285N.
The common primary structures found here are as follows:
•	Ripple laminations
•	Trough trough cross 
•	Bidirectional cross bedding 
•	Tabular bedding 
 
Location 2:
