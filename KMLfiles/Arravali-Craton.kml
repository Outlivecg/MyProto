		<description><![CDATA[Arravali Craton occupies NW part of Indian shield covering an area of over 1 lakh sq.km. It consists of Mewar craton in the east & Marwar craton in the west. Aravalli craton is bounded to the east by Great Boundary Fault, to the west by   sands of Thar desert, to the north by Indo-Gangetic alluvium and to the south by Son-Narmada-Tapti lineament. Predominantly consists of quartzites, marbles, pelites, greywackes and volcanocs, exposed in Aravalli-Delhi orogen. It is distinguished by the largest felsic volcanic province of India, world (Malani Igneous Suite) (R. S. Sharma, 2009).

			<description><![CDATA[Aravalli craton occupies NW part of Indian shield covering an area of over 1 lakh sq.km. It consists of Mewar craton in the east & Marwar craton in the west. Aravalli craton is bounded to the east by Great Boundary Fault, to the west by   sands of Thar desert, to the north by Indo-Gangetic alluvium and to the south by Son-Narmada-Tapti lineament. Predominantly consists of quartzites, marbles, pelites, greywackes and volcanocs, exposed in Aravalli-Delhi orogen. It is distinguished by the largest felsic volcanic province of India, world (Malani Igneous Suite) (R. S. Sharma, 2009).
