Area Offshore: 116000 sq. km. <br/>
Isobath: Upto 200m <br/>
The Bombay offshore region of the western continental shelf of India forms an important hydrocarbon bearing province and comprises sediments of Cenozoic age. This basin is extending from Saurashtra Coast in the North to Vengurla arch near Goa in the South. <br/>
Evolution of Bombay Offshore started during break-up of Gondwana Land in Late Cretaceous. This basin experienced deposition of thick Tertiary sedimentary sequences over a predominantly Deccan Trap floor. Tectonically I the basin can be subdivided into Surat depression, Bombay High platform, Ratnagiri block, Shelf margin basin and the Shelf-edge basement arc. <br/>
Bombay Offshore Basin is producing nearly 70% oil and gas of India’s toltal hydrocarbon production. The Bombay High is the only giant oil field so far discovered in Bombay offshore Basin as well as in India. The medium sized Oil field are Panna, Neelam, Heera and Ratnagiri. The Bassein, Daman, Mid Tapti and south Tapti are the major gas fields in this basin. The Shales alternate with the limestone, deposited in local depression of the above age, also act as source rock. The limestone of early Miocene- Eocene sequence also contributed for hydrocarbon generation. The main reservoir rock in this basin is limestone sequence of different ages. In addition to it, sand, stone and siltstone sequence also occur as reservoir rocks. <br/>
