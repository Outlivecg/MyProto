Area Offshore: 2500 sq. km. <br/>
The Cambay Basin is an intra -cratonic graben and bounded by series of faults one after another paralleling the Dharwar trend and cuts across the Narmada and Aravalli trends. This basin extends to the North in offshore as a narrow graben. The graben is parallel with the coast between mainland and Bombay High. The Cambay Basin can be divided into six tectonic blocks, namely; Sanchor block, Tharad block, Ahmedabad-Mehsana block, Tarapur block, Broach block and Narmada block.<br/>
The Cambay Shale is the main source rock in this basin. The organic matter content averages to 2.5% and mainly of sapropelic and humic in nature. The sandstone and siltstone of Ankleshwar, Kalol and Kadi Formations are the main reservoir rocks in this basin. The traps are structural, stratigraphic and combination type in this basin. Cambay Shale acts as cap rock for hydrocarbon deposits in Kadi Formation and VagadKhol Formation, whereas in the northern part, Tarapur Shale acts as cap rock. Telwa Shale of Ankleshwar Formation and Kanwa Shale in South of Mahisagar river also serve as cap rock.
