		<description><![CDATA[Singhbhum Craton (SBC) is also called Singhbhum-Orissa craton in eastern India. It is made of Archaean rocks that are exposed in an area of ~40,000 km in Singhbhum district of Jharkhand (formerly Bihar) and northern part of the State of Orissa. The craton is bordered by Chhotanagpur Gneissic Complex to the north, Eastern Ghats mobile belt to the southeast, Bastar craton to the southwest, and alluvium to the east. Much of the geological information about Singhbhum craton (SC) or Singhbhum Granite Complex (SGC) is due to Saha (1994). The following rock-suite constitutes the Singhbhum craton: <br/>
1. Singhbhum Granite (I, II, III phases) with enclaves of (i) Older Metamorphic Group (OMG), and (ii) Older Metamorphic Tonalite Gneiss (OMTG). <br/>
2. Iron Ore Group (IOG,) dominantly Banded Iron formation (BIF) at the margin of the Singhbhum Granite.<br/>
3. Volcanics or greenstone belts like Simlipal, Dhanjori, Dalma etc. (R. S. Sharma, 2009).
