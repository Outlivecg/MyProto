		<description><![CDATA[Chhotanagpur Granite-Gneiss Complex
Chhotanagpur Granite-Gneiss Complex was first considered to be the mobile belt. But, at present CGGC is considered as craton. Please refer latest contribution by Sanyal and Sengupta (2012), Palaeoproterozoic of India.
<br/>
The Complex is considered here as a cratonic region whose convergence with the Singhbhum craton to the south gave rise to the Singhbhum mobile belt. It covers an area of about 100,000 km and extends in the E-W across the states of Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, Orissa and West Bengal. The Chhotanagpur Granite-Gneiss Complex (CGGC) is bordered on the north by Gangetic alluvium, on the south by Singhbhum mobile belt and on the northeast by the Rajmahal basalt. Early regional studies on the CGGC are by Ghose (1983), Mazumder (1979, 1988), Banerji (1991) and Singh (1998), but no regional map of the entire cratonic region was available until Mahadevan compiled a geological map (R. S. Sharma, 2009).
